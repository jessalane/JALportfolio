      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        For me, coding began as a hobby. Back when I was about fifteen I studied it on my own, because it was useful in
        games I was playing. I studied and worked with code deployed on Jcink Forums. Through that, I learned CSS and
        HTML with the aid of tutorials, as well as trial and error.
        <br><br>
        It took years to realize that something I enjoyed so much could prove to be a career. This career is something
        I've loved for most of my life. It's something I'm good at, and I am excited for the chance to work in the
        field.
        <br><br>
        In my free time I enjoy reading, writing, and traveling. I'm someone who loves a challenge, and tend to get far
        too competitive in games. Even in failure, I love a good challenge, and know my career in web development will
        offer that. I'm currently a student in the Coding Bootcamp offered through University of Utah. I should be
        finished with the course in November of 2022.
