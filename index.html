          For me, coding began as a hobby. Back when I was about fifteen I studied it on my own, because it was useful in games I was playing. I studied and played with code deployed on Jcink Forums, and learned through trial and error. It took most of my life to realize that something I enjoyed so much could prove to be a career. This career is something I enjoy, and something I'm good at, and I am excited for the chance to work in the field. 
          <br><br>
          In my free time I enjoy reading, writing, and traveling. I'm someone who loves a challenge, and tend to get far too competitive in games. Even in failure, I love a good challenge, and know my career in web development will offer that. I'm currently a student in the Coding Bootcamp offered through University of Utah. I should be finished with the course in November of 2022.
