# <JALportfolio>

## Description
This project was created to serve as my working portfolio when I have a larger body of work to share. As of now it is the front end of the website. I would like to add in working forms so clients can contact me by email from the website it's self. I would also like to add in applications I've actually worked on. 

## Usage
The following is a picture of what the website should look like when opened in a browser. 
```md
